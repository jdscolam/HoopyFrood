A minimal and opinionated Angular template based on HotTowel

>The type of towel Ford would use when starting a new adventure

## Thanks

A huge shout-out to [John Pappa](http://johnpapa.net/) for the [original HotTowel](https://github.com/johnpapa/HotTowel-Angular) Angular template, and the new [generator-hottowel](https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel).

Thanks to Mitch Cooper and Stephen Olner for inadvertently giving me the idea, and to my family for encouraging me to come up with neat stuff.
