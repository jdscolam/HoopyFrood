# HoopyFrood
A minimal and opinionated Angular template based on HotTowel

>The type of towel Ford would use when starting a new adventure

### Usage

Either install it using the [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HoopyFrood) package manager via 'Install-Package HoopyFrood' or download the zip from GitHub and copy/paste files as appropriate.

**NOTE** Though built using Visual Studio, the template/layout here is completely compatable with various other non-Microsoft based hosts.  As long as the appropriate JavaScript libraries are included there should be no problems on any other platform.

## Thanks

A huge shout-out to [John Pappa](http://johnpapa.net/) for the [original HotTowel](https://github.com/johnpapa/HotTowel-Angular) Angular template, and the new [generator-hottowel](https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel).

Thanks to Mitch Cooper and Stephen Olner for inadvertently giving me the idea, and to my family for encouraging me to come up with neat stuff.
